# More Details
Have you ever wanted a talking house? Now you can! With my Big Talker SmartApp ( http://github.com/rayzurbock/SmartThings-BigTalker )

When SmartThings is paired with a speech synthesis device (such as a Sonos or VLC Thing ( http://community.smartthings.com/t/vlc-thing-a-poor-mans-sonos/5433 )) and my Big Talker SmartApp, your house can say what you want it to say when events occur.

Currently supported events:

* Motion, Active/Inactive
* Switch, On/Off
* Presence, Arrive/Depart
* Lock, Lock/Unlock
* Contact, Open/Close
* Mode, Change (Home, Away, etc)
* Thermostat, Cooling/Heating/Fan/Idle(not running)

Each supported event supports 3 different groups so that you can alter your spoken phrases based on which group your selection of devices is configured in.

Voice phrases support the following variables (to be filled in at runtime)

* %devicename% = Triggering devices display name
* %devicetype% = Triggering device type; motion, switch, etc...
* %devicechange% = State change that occurred; on/off, active/inactive, etc...
* %locationname% = Hub Location name; home, work, etc...
* %lastmode% = Last home mode; home, away, etc...
* %mode% = Current home mode; home, away, etc...

For example when turning off a switch named "Office Light" with a spoken phrase of "%devicename% %devicetype% has been turned %devicechange%" would speak "Office light switch has been turned off"

I have a virtual switch that turns on/off all of my Christmas tree's and interior Christmas lights. I configured Big Talker's switch event for Group 1 with this virtual switch and when turned on to speak "Merry Christmas". The family loves it!

Keep in mind, if you configure highly active or too many devices, it may get annoying!! We had a family gathering tonight and the kids kept going in/out the back door to play in the yard. "Back Door has been opened, Back Door has been closed, Back Door has been opened, you get the idea." I wouldn't configure chatty motion sensors either, but that's up to you.

Have Fun!
